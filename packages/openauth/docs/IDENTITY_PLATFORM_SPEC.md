## Interactions

### A. SSO Login Flow

```
User → App A (not logged in)
     → Auth Server /authorize?client_id=app-a&prompt=none
     → Auth Server checks session
     → [Session exists] → Redirect to App A with code
     → [No session] → Redirect with error=login_required
     → App A shows login button
     → User clicks login
     → Auth Server /authorize?client_id=app-a
     → User authenticates
     → Session created (7 days)
     → Redirect to App A with code
     → App A exchanges code for tokens
     → User logged in
```

### B. SSO Cross-App Flow

```
User logged into App A
     → Visits App B
     → App B redirects to Auth Server /authorize?client_id=app-b&prompt=none
     → Auth Server finds existing session
     → Issues new authorization code for App B
     → Redirect to App B
     → App B exchanges code for its own tokens
     → User logged into App B (no login UI shown)
```

### C. Add Account Flow

```
User logged in as Account 1
     → Clicks "Add account"
     → Auth Server /authorize?prompt=login&action=add_account
     → Login UI shown (existing session preserved)
     → User authenticates as Account 2
     → Account 2 added to browser session
     → Account 2 becomes active
     → Redirect back to app
     → Now 2 accounts in session
```

### D. Switch Account Flow

```
User has 2 accounts, Account 1 is active
     → Clicks account switcher
     → Auth Server /authorize?prompt=select_account
     → Account picker UI shown
     → User selects Account 2
     → Account 2 becomes active
     → New tokens issued for Account 2
     → Redirect back to app
```

### E. Sign Out One Account

```
User has 3 accounts logged in
     → Opens account menu
     → Clicks "Sign out" on Account 2
     → DELETE /session/accounts/user_456
     → Account 2 removed from browser session
     → If Account 2 was active, Account 1 becomes active
     → 2 accounts remain
```

### F. Admin Force Logout

```
Admin views user in dashboard
     → Sees user has 5 active sessions
     → Clicks "Terminate all sessions"
     → POST /admin/users/{userId}/sessions/revoke-all
     → All sessions for user invalidated
     → All refresh tokens revoked
     → User must re-authenticate on all devices
     → Audit event logged
```

### G. Token Per App with Permissions

```
User with role "editor" logs into App A
     → App A requests scope: "read write"
     → Token issued:
       {
         sub: "user_123",
         aud: "app-a",
         roles: ["editor"],
         permissions: ["articles:read", "articles:write"]
       }

Same user logs into App B (admin dashboard)
     → App B requests scope: "admin"
     → Token issued:
       {
         sub: "user_123",
         aud: "app-b",
         roles: ["editor"],
         permissions: ["dashboard:view"]  // editor has limited admin access
       }
```

### H. Multi-Tenant White-Label

```
Tenant: "client-corp"
     → Domain: auth.clientcorp.com
     → Branding: Client Corp logo, blue theme
     → Users: Only Client Corp employees
     → Apps: client-corp-app-1, client-corp-app-2
     → Roles: client-corp-admin, client-corp-user

Tenant: "alummahnow" (default)
     → Domain: auth.alummahnow.net
     → Branding: AlUmmahNow logo, green theme
     → Users: AlUmmahNow users
     → Apps: profile-app, admin-dashboard, news-app
     → Roles: admin, user, moderator
```
